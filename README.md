SymfonyExamples
===============

This repo consists of several example projects built to demonstrate the use of the PHP web framework, [Symfony](http://symfony.com).

Currently, example projects include:

* QuickTour


Running Application
===================

For a simple method for running the application that does not require a production Web Server, one can use PHP's built-in web server via Symfony CLI commands:

  * Change directory to your project root directory:
    ```cd QuickTour```
  * Run Symfony CLI command for launching PHP's built-in web server:
    ```php app/console server:run```

Application will now listen on localhost:8000
